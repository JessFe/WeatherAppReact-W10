# Weather App React

This Weather App, developed in React, represents my journey into creating a dynamic and responsive weather forecasting application.
Utilizing the Open Weather API, the app delivers real-time weather updates, forecasts, and more with a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- Responsive Design: Fully adaptable interface for an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
- Live Weather Data: Powered by Open Weather API for up-to-date weather information.
- Custom Backgrounds: The app's background changes with the weather, enhancing the visual experience.
